Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor

AutoML: H2O
H2O is a fully open-source, distributed in-memory machine learning platform with linear scalability. H2O supports the most widely used statistical & machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosted machines, generalized linear models, deep learning, and many more.

H2Oâ€™s AutoML can be used for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit.

H2O offers a number of model explainability methods that apply to AutoML objects (groups of models), as well as individual models (e.g. leader model). Explanations can be generated automatically with a single function call, providing a simple interface to exploring and explaining the AutoML models. H2O: AutoML
